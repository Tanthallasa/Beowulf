Arteria3d Summer Promotion - Medieval Knight With Sword & Shield

Thakns for downloading this pack
There are no shader maps provided with this free version of this model.

The model is provided in two animation formats - multitrack, and single track
By default in the model folder, the character contains multitrack animations.  These are animations that show up as named
tracks in your game engine - importing the FBX into unity, will provide all the animations as already separate named
tracks, so you dont have to split the animation timeline yourself.

For engines such as gamestudio use the FBX import in the single track folder, that contains animations in single track format,
whereby you use start/stop times to trigger specific animations
